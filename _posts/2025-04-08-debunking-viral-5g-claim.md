## The Claim

A viral video with over 10 million views shows birds falling from the sky near what the narrator claims is a newly installed 5G tower in the Netherlands. The caption states: "5G kills birds instantly - what is it doing to humans?"

## The Facts

### 1. The Location and Timing

The video was indeed filmed in The Hague, Netherlands, but in October 2018, not recently as implied. During this period, there was a bird die-off event in the Huijgenspark area.

### 2. 5G Testing Status

According to the Netherlands Authority for Digital Infrastructure, no 5G testing was occurring in that specific area at the time of the incident. The first limited 5G tests in The Hague didn't begin until several months later, in different neighborhoods.

### 3. Actual Cause of Bird Deaths

Official investigation by Dutch authorities determined the birds (primarily starlings) died due to poisoning from yew berries. Toxicology reports confirmed the presence of taxine, a cardiotoxic compound found in yew plants, in the digestive systems of the affected birds.

### 4. Scientific Research on 5G and Wildlife

Multiple peer-reviewed studies have examined potential effects of RF radiation from telecommunications equipment on wildlife. Current scientific consensus shows that 5G frequencies used in commercial networks do not produce sufficient energy to cause acute harm to birds or other wildlife.

## The Verdict

**FALSE**: The claim that 5G towers caused birds to fall from the sky is not supported by evidence. The video shows a real bird die-off incident that was investigated and attributed to poisoning from natural sources, not telecommunications equipment.

This type of misinformation plays into broader unfounded fears about 5G technology that lack scientific support. While ongoing research into potential subtle ecological effects of RF radiation continues, there is no credible evidence for the dramatic claims made in the viral video.

## Why This Matters

Misinformation about technology can:
- Create unnecessary public fear
- Distract from legitimate environmental concerns
- Lead to vandalism of important infrastructure
- Undermine trust in scientific institutions

Always verify extraordinary claims with reliable sources and look for official investigation results rather than accepting viral videos at face value.
